# Text Sentimental Analysis with Speech Recognition
**This Project for Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning Courses in Benha Faculty of Computers & AI - Egypt**

   Welcome to this notebook, This notebook is about implementing Sentiment Analysis on English Voiced-Text, thanks for using [Sentiment dataset with 1 million tweets](https://free-electronic.com/product/arduino-pro-micro-atmega32u4/) & [Youtube Statistics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaypatil/youtube-statistics/versions/1) .

   Both datasets are used for the variations of Positive & Negative expressions for different situations on social media, whether it is a *feedback*, *expressing feelings*, discussions and lot more, and that's obviously is easy with today **SOCIAL MEDIA**.
   
   nowadays, there are many efforts to make controlling machines easier, i.e. controlling machines with voice instead of typing some shell commands, even sharing your own feelings with voice instead of typing some words, express your feedback as much as you want !
   
   **TO DEFINE IT MORE CLEARLY,** our problem is to Analyize (Classify) the sentiment of our English Voiced-Text if it is Positive or Negative, which is *Binary Classification*
